## Selection Process

Products were selected based on usability and the perceivable ease which they will be integrated on a surface-mount PCB.

The following devices were researched: **Stepper motors** and **Stepper motor drivers**.

| Stepper Motor | Pros/Cons |
|---|---|
| Device 1: name<br> (image) | **Pros:**<br>-Bla <br>-bla <br> **Cons:**<br>-Bla<br>-bla|
| Device 2: name<br>(image) | **Pros:**<br>-Bla <br>-bla <br> **Cons:**<br>-Bla<br>-bla|
| Device 3: name<br>(image) | **Pros:**<br>-Bla <br>-bla <br> **Cons:**<br>-Bla<br>-bla|

| Stepper Motor Driver | Pros/Cons |
|---|---|
| Device 1: Onsemi NCV7708FDWR2G Double Hex Driver <br>![Image of IC](//docs/static/media/NCV7708FDWR2G.png)<br>[DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/onsemi/NCV7708FDWR2G/9829237) [*Datasheet*](https://www.onsemi.com/pdf/datasheet/ncv7708f-d.pdf) **Cost: $5.83/unit**  | **Pros:**<br> - Large package size (easier assembly) <br> - Clear SPI datasheet<br> **Cons:**<br> - Large pin count (several unused pins)<br> - No express stepper motor drive functions (the device is not expressly designed for stepper motors).|
| Device 2: name<br>(image) | **Pros:**<br>-Bla <br>-bla <br> **Cons:**<br>-Bla<br>-bla|
| Device 3: name<br>(image) | **Pros:**<br>-Bla <br>-bla <br> **Cons:**<br>-Bla<br>-bla|
